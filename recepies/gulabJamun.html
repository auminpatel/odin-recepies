  <h2>Gulab Jamun or Kala Jam</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
    These are like little waffle balls that sit in and absorb a sugary rosewater syrup. It was first made on the Indian
    subcontinent, around South Asia. Gulab Juman originated from Luqmat Al-Qadi, an Arabic dessert. This dessert is
    popular at weddings, Diwali, Eid Al-Fitr and Eid Al-Adha. There a several different types of jamun with different
    looks and taste. Serve hot or cold.

  <p>Try adding ice cream to these hot waffle balls, you'll be <strong> addicted!</strong></p>

  The longer you leave the waffle balls in the syrup the better it is going to be; some people leave the waffle balls
  overnight.

    Ingredients
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>2 drops rose water (Optional)</li>
    <li>1 pinch saffron (Optional)</li>
    <li>½ cup instant dry milk powder (such as Carnation®)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter (such as Land O'Lakes®)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps to make recipe</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer
      until consistency is syrupy, 5 to 10 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined. Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until
      dough comes together. Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.

    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Test the temperature of the oil by
      dropping in a small piece of dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the
      surface, the oil is ready.</li>
    <li>
      Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a
      paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining gulab.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat and let them soak in the syrup, covered,
      45 minutes to 1 hour.
    </li>
  </ol>
